# 🏠 Homelab Infrastructure

This repository contains the **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** setup for my personal homelab. It uses:

- **Terraform** for provisioning virtual machines and networks on Proxmox
- **Ansible** for configuring and deploying services inside the VMs

> ⚠️ Work in progress — I'm learning Terraform and Ansible, and gradually automating more of my setup.
